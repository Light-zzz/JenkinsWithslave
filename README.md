# HTML & CSS Mini Projects

Welcome to the **HTML & CSS Mini Projects** repository! This collection showcases various mini-projects created to enhance my front-end development skills. Each project explores different aspects of web design, user interface components, and CSS techniques. This is part of my continuous journey to master HTML and CSS.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to build, practice, and refine web development skills by creating small, focused projects. Each project demonstrates a unique design feature or technique such as:

- Interactive animations  
- Responsive layouts  
- Creative form designs

By consistently working on these projects, I aim to gain deeper insights into front-end development and expand my knowledge of modern web design.
