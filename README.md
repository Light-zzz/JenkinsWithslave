## About

The goal of this repository is to practice and improve my web development skills by building a series of small, focused projects. Each project aims to highlight a specific design element or feature, such as animations, layout structures, form designs, or responsive techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language for creating the structure of the projects.
- **CSS3**: Stylesheet language for styling, animations, and layout design.
