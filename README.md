## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to build, practice, and refine web development skills by creating small, focused projects. Each project demonstrates a unique design feature or technique such as:

- Interactive animations  
- Responsive layouts  
- Creative form designs  
- Hover effects  
- Neumorphism and glassmorphism UI  

By consistently working on these projects, I aim to gain deeper insights into front-end development and expand my knowledge of modern web design.
